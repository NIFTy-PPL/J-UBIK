J-UBIK User Guide
=================

This guide is an overview and explains the main conceptual idea behind J-UBIK (JAX-accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit for X-ray). The software package is based on :ref:`NIFTY.re <https://github.com/NIFTy-PPL/NIFTy>`, a software package designed for accelerated Bayesian inference. J-UBIK facilitates the implementation of the central components of Bayesian inference, namely likelihood models for different instruments and prior models, and currently includes implementations for X-ray telescopes (Chandra and eROSITA) as well as the infrared observatory JWST.


More details on the API and the demos for the different instruments can be found at the `API reference <../mod/jubik0.html>`_.

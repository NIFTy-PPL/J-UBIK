    """
    Builds linear (higher orders not yet supported) rotation_and_shift model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sky_dvol: float
        The volume of the sky/reconstruction pixels
    sub_dvol: float
        The volume of the subsample pixels.
        Typically, the data pixel is subsampled
    order: int
        The order of the rotation_and_shift scheme
        (only linear supported by JAX)
    sky_as_brightness:
        If True, the sky will be treated as a brightness distribution.
        This is the same as setting sky_dvol = 1.
    mode: str
        The mode of the interpolation.

    Returns
    -------
    rotation_shift_subsample : function
        The rotation_and_shift function

    Notes
    -----
    The sky is the reconstruction array, we assume a one-to-one relation
    between the sky brightness and the flux:
        flux(x, y) = sky(x, y) * sky_dvol

    Parameters
    ----------
    observation: Observation
        The observation under question
    field_name:
        The name of the field (pointing)
    sky_beamer:

    Result
    ------
    The likelihood which takes the beam-corrected sky corresponding to the
    `observation`, which gets transformed to visibility space and compared to
    the visibilities in the observation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sky_beamer: SkyBeamerJft
        The SkyBeamer transforms a sky into a dictionary of different fields
        with applied beam patterns. The keys correspond to different pointings.
    observations: list[Observation]
        A list of observations, which are assumed to hold one pointing (field).

        The accuracy of the sky2vis operation (Nufft).
    direction_key: str
        The key in the observation which corresponds to the pointing direction.
